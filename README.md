# Jenkkins-Notes
## 🧩 What is Jenkins..?
### Ans: Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java, used mainly for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) — together called CI/CD pipeline.

## 💡 Simple Definition: 
### Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your code — so developers can focus on writing code instead of manually deploying or testing.

## ⚙️ Why Use Jenkins?
### Main Features In Jenkins
* Automation	>>>>>> Builds, tests, and deploys automatically when code changes
* Plugins	>>>>>> 1,800+ plugins for integration (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
* CI/CD Pipeline	>>>>>> Automates the entire development workflow
* Integration	>>>>>>> Works with Git, GitHub, Maven, Docker, Terraform, etc.
* Scalability	>>>>>>> Can distribute builds across multiple nodes (Master–Slave setup)

## 🧱 Jenkins Architecture
### Main Components Of Architechture
* Jenkins Master	>>>>>> Controls the entire process — schedules jobs, monitors nodes
* Jenkins Agent/Slave	>>>>>>> Executes the build jobs assigned by the master
* Job/Pipeline	>>>>>>> A defined process (like build → test → deploy)
* Plugin	>>>>>> Adds extra features (e.g., Docker plugin, Git plugin)
