# Jenkkins-Notes
## 🧩 What is Jenkins..?
### Ans: Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java, used mainly for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) — together called CI/CD pipeline.

## 💡 Simple Definition: Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your code — so developers can focus on writing code instead of manually deploying or testing.
